# CDSS-Hackathon
Invention's Marketing Value Prediction Project

This project is a 2018 Columbia Data Science Society Hackathon project sponsored by Facebook. After two days work, we managed to achieve 3rd Place.

• Joined 9 datasets and built a data cleaning, feature engineering and feature selection pipeline to identify inventions with great potential market values in Python

• Fit a neural network model on selected features to classify the inventions’ wealth return ability with an accuracy of 78%.
